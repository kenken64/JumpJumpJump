## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

2. ❌ Don't buy followers/upvotes - kills credibility
3. ❌ Don't argue with critics - thank them for feedback
4. ❌ Don't post without visuals - GIFs/videos get 10x engagement
5. ❌ Don't ignore comments - engage within first hour
6. ❌ Don't post same content everywhere - customize per platform
7. ❌ Don't give up after one post - consistency is key
